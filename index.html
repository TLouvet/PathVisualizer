    <h2>How to</h2>
    <p>Adjust the size of the grid with the parameters from the grid display options. Please note that changing the size
      erase the current grid</p>
    <p>Select the pathfinding Algorithm that you wish to see in action. You can change it anytime, it will recalculate
      the path</p>
    <p>Select the number of directions to search. 4 directions search will check for Top, Bottom, Right and Left nodes.
      8 directions will also add the diagonals.</p>
    <p>Place the start and end buttons on the grid to start the calculation. You can add walls to update the path. Use
      "Remove Placement" to remove a wall or start/end point</p>

  <h2>WIP - Algorithm explanation</h2>
  <section id="algo-explained-DFS" class="algo-explained-container">
    <div>
      <h2>How DFS works</h2>
      <p>The Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm explores paths until either a solution is found or the path is blocked.
        While there are various ways to implement this algorithm, the core logic remains consistent. Starting from the
        current node, the algorithm examines available directions to determine which nodes it can visit. In the context
        of a grid, nodes eligible for visitation are either empty or represent the end node. Notably, nodes that have
        already been visited are not revisited.</p>

      <p>In the implementation presented here, the algorithm prioritizes adjacent nodes based on their Manhattan
        distance
        to the target end node. This approach enhances performance compared to random selection, as it strategically
        moves towards the goal with each step, resulting in a more deterministic and efficient solution.</p>

      <p>An alternate approach involves exploring nodes in a predetermined order, such as Top, Right, Bottom, Left.
        This also offers a deterministic outcome. In contrast, a non-deterministic approach would involve selecting
        random adjacent nodes repeatedly until the end node is reached.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Algorithm - Typescript</h3>
      <p>Here is my implementation of the algorithm</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          dfs(start: GraphNode, end: GraphNode) {
            if (start.node.id === end.node.id) {
              this.path.display();
              end.changeState(new PathEndState()); // we have overriden the end state during the search
              return true;
            }
        
            const adjacentNodes = this.searchComponent.getAdjacentNodes(start);
            adjacentNodes.sort((a, b) => this.getManhattanDistance(a, end) - this.getManhattanDistance(b, end));
            for (const node of adjacentNodes) {
              node.changeState(new PathVisitedState());
              this.path.push(node);
              if (this.dfs(node, end)) {
                return true;
              }
              this.path.pop();
            }
        
            return false;
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>Assuming both a start and an end node are provided (with prior verification), the algorithm compares their IDs
        to determine if they are the same. The utilization of a GraphNode structure, containing an HTML node, allows for
        ID-based comparison. A match indicates the discovery of a viable path.</p>

      <p>The 'path' class used in the code functions as a stack, recording the nodes that will be used as a solution.
      </p>

      <p>The loop is quite simple: Look at each node, push it in the stack and recursively traverse the graph. If the
        node is part of the solution, then
        the loop will stop at the if statement returning true inside of it. If not, the node is popped from the stack
        and we get to the next node.</p>

      <p>In the end, if none of the adjacent nodes was a viable node, we reject this solution (that will trigger a pop()
        in the previous call)</p>

      <h3>Pros and Cons</h3>
      <p>Pros:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Simple to implement</li>
        <li>Efficient processing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Cons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Does not guarantee the shortest path</li>
        <li>May generate suboptimal paths in the presence of obstacles along the main route</li>
      </ul>

  <section id="algo-explained-BFS" class="algo-explained-container">
    <h2>How BFS works</h2>
    <p>The Breadth First Search Algorithm works very differently from the DFS. From a starting point, it will expand in
      every possible direction until it finds the
      end node. Once the node is found, it will backtrack to the start node and mark the path. This is done by giving
      each node a parent. In BFS, the parent node to a given current node is
      simply the node that discovered it.</p>

    <p>Contrarily to the DFS algorithm which uses a Stack structure to traverse the grid, BFS uses a Queue structure,
      which means the first node that enters is
      also the first one to be explored (FIFO).

      <p>Cons</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Might visit a ton of nodes and thus is not optimized</li>
